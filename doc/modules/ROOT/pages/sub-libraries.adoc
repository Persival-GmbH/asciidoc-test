= Sub-Libraries

Introduction to sub-libraries? Or is this redundant with the organization profile?


## SL1 - Perception Sensor Models

This sub-library is a collection of https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface[OSI] compliant sensor models according to the https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging[OSMP] specification including a template repository
demonstrating the https://setlevel.de/assets/forschungsergebnisse/Credible-Simulation-Process-v1.0.pdf[Credible Simulation Process] by running full scale https://ssp-standard.org/[SSP] based co-simulations in the CI pipeline.

## SL2 - Traffic Participant Models

This sub-library is a set of OSI compliant traffic participant models, which include pedestrian models, SSP based ALKS systems, automated road users and others to demonstrate closed loop simulations in combination with other sub-libraries utilizing open-source simulators such as https://github.com/esmini/esmini[esmini].

## SL3 - Scenario Data

This sub-library contains example scenario data following the https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openscenario/[ASAM OpenSCENARIO] standard to provide interpretations for legislative documents such as the UN Regulation No. 157 in order to discuss them in the community.
In addition, the best practices to establish quality gates for scenario databases to clearly show the quality of scenario data are shown.

## SL4 - Static Environment Data

The German research project https://www.gaia-x4plcaad.info/[GaiaX 4 PLC-AAD] develops quality metrics and tools to evaluate the successful integration of https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive[ASAM OpenDRIVE] maps
with e.g. https://www.khronos.org/gltf/[glTF] 3D models and their respective material data extentions.
