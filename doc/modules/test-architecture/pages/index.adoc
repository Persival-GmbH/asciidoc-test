= OSMP Test Architecture

The OSMP Test Architecture is designed to test any simulation model complying to the [OSMP](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging) specification.
A variety of model types from environmental effect models over sensor models to traffic participant models can be tested with this architecture.
The architecture is divided into 3 main test levels based on the credibility assessment level definition by Ahmann et al. [[1](#Ahmann2022)].
Because the test architecture is specifically designed for OpenMSL open source models, a license check is needed.
The license check is preceding the 3 main credibility assessment levels as level 0.
This yields the following credibility assessment level line-up:

- CL 0: [License Check](#cl-0-license-check)
- CL 1: [Code Verification](#cl-1-code-verification)
- CL 2: [Qualitative Verification](#cl-2-qualitative-verification)
- CL 3: [Quantitative Verification](#cl-3-quantitative-verification)

Every credibility assessment level is tested with a separate GitHub action and is further described in the following sections.
